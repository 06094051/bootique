        <title>What is Bootique</title>
        <para>Bootique is a minimally opinionated technology for building container-less runnable
            Java applications. No JavaEE container required to run your app! It is an ideal platform
            for <emphasis><link xlink:href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"
                    >microservices</link></emphasis>, as it allows you to create a fully functional
            app with minimal-to-no setup. Though it is not limited to a specific kind of app (or the
            "micro" size) and can be used for REST services, webapps, runnable jobs, DB migrations,
            JavaFX GUI apps to mention a few examples.</para>
        <para>Unlike traditional container-based apps, Bootique allows you to control your
                <code>main()</code> method and create Java apps that behave like simple executable
            commands that can be run with
            Java:<programlisting language="bourne">java -jar my.jar [arguments]</programlisting></para>
        <para>Each Bootique app can be started with a YAML configuration loaded from a file or from
            a remote URL. Among other benefits, such configuration approach ideally suits cloud
            deployment environments.</para>
        <para>Bootique was inspired by two similar products - <link
                xlink:href="http://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</link> and <link
                xlink:href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">SpringBoot</link>, however its
            focus is different. Bootique favors modularity and clean pluggable architecture.
            Bootique is built on top of <link xlink:href="https://github.com/google/guice">Google
                Guice</link> dependency injection (DI) container, which provides the core of its
            modularity mechanism. This means that pretty much anything in Bootique can be
            customized/overridden to your liking.</para>

            <para>Java 8 or newer is required. </para>

            <title>Build System</title>
            <para>Bootique apps can be built using any Java build system (Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc).
                Examples in the documentation are based on Maven and
                <code>maven-shade-plugin</code>. While this is not strictly a requirement, Bootique
                apps are usually packaged into "fat" runnable jars and don't have any external
                dependencies beyond the JRE.</para>

            <title>Programming Skills</title>
            <para>Everyting you know about Java programming will be applicable when working with
            Bootique. You may need to "unlearn" some of the practices related to JavaEE
            configuration and container deployment though. </para>
            <para>Integration between various parts of a Bootique app is done via <link
                xlink:href="https://github.com/google/guice">Google Guice</link>. In most cases
            Bootique API would steer you towards idiomatic approach to integration, so deep
            knowledge of Guice is not required. Though it wouldn't hurt to understand a few main
            concepts: modules, bindings, <link
                xlink:href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Multibindings"

                >ServiceLoader</link> facility is another important part of Bootique, and probably
            yet another thing that you shouldn't worry too much about initially.</para>
