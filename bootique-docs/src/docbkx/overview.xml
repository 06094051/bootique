        <title>What is Bootique</title>
        <para>Bootique is a minimally opinionated technology for building container-less runnable
            Java applications. No JEE container required! It is an ideal platform for
                    <emphasis><link xlink:href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"
                    >microservices</link></emphasis>, as it allows you to create a fully functional
            app with minimal-to-no setup. It is not limited to a specific kind of app (or the
            "micro" size) though and can be used for REST services, webapps, runnable jobs, DB
            migrations, JavaFX GUI apps to mention a few examples.</para>
        <para>Bootique was inspired by two similar products - <link
                xlink:href="http://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</link> and <link
                xlink:href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">SpringBoot</link>, however its
            focus is different. Bootique favors modularity and clean pluggable architecture.
            Bootique is built on top of <link xlink:href="https://github.com/google/guice">Google
                Guice</link> DI container, which provides the core of its modularity
            mechanism.</para>
