Bootique is an unopinionated technology for building single-jar runnable Java applications of any kind. With Bootique you can create and run REST services, webapps, jobs, etc. as if they were simple commands. No JEE container required!

Bootique was inspired by two similar products - [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io) and [SpringBoot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), however its focus is different. Bootique favors modularity and clean pluggable architecture.

Bootique is built on top of [Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) DI container, that is the core of its modularity mechanism.
