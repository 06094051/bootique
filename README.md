Bootique is a simple DI-based framework for building single-jar Java applications of any kind. With Bootique you can create and run REST services, webapps, jobs, etc., as if they were simple commands. No JEE container required!

Bootique was inspired by two similar products - [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io) and [SpringBoot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), however Bootique's focus is different. It is "unopinionated" in regards to the contents of your app and what services should be there by default. Bootique favors modularity and clean architecture over immediate convenience.
